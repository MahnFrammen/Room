My entry for CST-310 Project 4 - Rendering Scene with Primitives.

To run the program:
1. Download the files RoomA.cpp, Shader.h, shader.vert and shader.frag from the GitHub repository
2. Save them to the same directory and open that directory in the Ubuntu terminal
3. Use the following commands to run the program and display the scene: 'g++ -o RoomA RoomA.cpp -lglfw -lGL -lX11' './RoomA'

Packages lGLFW, lGL and lX11 are used to run this program, which can be obtained by using command 'sudo apt-get install libGL-dev'
